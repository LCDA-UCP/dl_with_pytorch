    "<img src=\"img/transformers.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture was introduced in **June 2017**. The focus of the original research was on translation tasks. This was followed by the introduction of several influential models, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **June 2018**: ``GPT``, the first pretrained Transformer model, used for fine-tuning on various NLP tasks and obtained state-of-the-art results.\n",
    "- **October 2018**: ``BERT``, another large pretrained model, this one designed to produce better summaries of sentences (more on this in the next chapter!).\n",
    "- **February 2019**: ``GPT-2``, an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns.\n",
    "- **October 2019**: ``DistilBERT``, a distilled version of BERT that is 60% faster, 40% lighter in memory, and still retains 97% of BERT’s performance.\n",
    "- **October 2019**: ``BART`` and ``T5``, two large pretrained models using the same architecture as the original Transformer model (the first to do so).\n",
    "- **May 2020**: ``GPT-3``, an even bigger version of GPT-2 that is able to perform well on a variety of tasks without the need for fine-tuning (called **zero-shot learning**).\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is far from comprehensive and is just meant to highlight a few of the different kinds of Transformer models. Broadly, they can be grouped into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GPT-like** (also called auto-regressive Transformer models)\n",
    "2. **BERT-like** (also called auto-encoding Transformer models)\n",
    "3. **BART/T5-like** (also called sequence-to-sequence Transformer models)\n",

    "## Transformers are language models \n",
    "\n",
    "All the Transformer models mentioned above (``GPT``, ``BERT``, ``BART``, ``T5``, etc.) have been trained as **language models**. This means they have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a **self-supervised** fashion. **Self-supervised learning** is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!\n",

    "**Pretraining** is the act of training a model from scratch: the weights are randomly initialized, and the training starts without any prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/llm-training.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This pretraining is usually done on very large amounts of data. Therefore, it requires a very large corpus of data, and training can take up to several weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning**, on the other hand, is the training done after a model has been pretrained. To perform fine-tuning, you first acquire a pretrained language model, then perform additional training with a dataset specific to your task. Wait — why not simply train the model for your final use case from scratch? There are a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The pretrained model was already trained on a dataset that has some similarities with the fine-tuning dataset. The fine-tuning process is thus able to take advantage of knowledge acquired by the initial model during pretraining (for instance, with NLP problems, the pretrained model will have some kind of statistical understanding of the language you are using for your task).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since the pretrained model was already trained on lots of data, the fine-tuning requires way less data to get decent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the same reason, the amount of time and resources needed to get good results are much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one could leverage a pretrained model trained on the English language and then fine-tune it on an ``arXiv`` corpus, resulting in a science/research-based model. The fine-tuning will only require a limited amount of data: the knowledge the pretrained model has acquired is “transferred,” hence the term **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/fine-tuning.png\">\n",

    "Fine-tuning a model therefore has lower **time**, **data**, **financial**, and **environmental** costs. It is also quicker and easier to iterate over different fine-tuning schemes, as the training is less constraining than a full pretraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will also achieve better results than training from scratch (unless you have lots of data), which is why you should always try to leverage a **pretrained model** — one as close as possible to the task you have at hand — and fine-tune it.\n",

    "## Attention layers\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of **Transformer models** is that they are built with special layers called **attention layers**. In fact, the title of the paper introducing the Transformer architecture was *“Attention Is All You Need”*! In a nutshell, attention layers will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this into context, consider the task of translating text from English to French. Given the input *“You like this course”*, a translation model will need to also attend to the adjacent word *“You”* to get the proper translation for the word *“like”*, because in French the verb *“like”* is conjugated differently depending on the subject. The rest of the sentence, however, is not useful for the translation of that word. In the same vein, when translating *“this”*, the model will also need to pay attention to the word *“course”*, because *“this”* translates differently depending on whether the associated noun is masculine or feminine. Again, the other words in the sentence will not matter for the translation of *“course”*. With more complex sentences (and more complex grammar rules), the model would need to pay special attention to words that might appear farther away in the sentence to properly translate each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to any task associated with **natural language**: a word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Transformer architecture** was originally designed for translation. During training, the **encoder** receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the **decoder** receives the same sentences in the desired target language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can depend on what comes after as well as what comes before it in the sentence). The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (i.e., only the words before the word currently being generated). For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder, which then uses all the inputs from the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words. If it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard! For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.\n",

    "Note that the **first attention layer** in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, while the **second attention layer** uses the output of the encoder. This allows the decoder to access the entire input sentence to best predict the current word. This is especially useful because different languages often have grammatical rules that rearrange word order, or context provided later in a sentence may influence the translation of a particular word.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **attention mask** can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from focusing on certain special tokens — for example, the **padding tokens** that are added to standardize the length of inputs when batching sentences together.\n"
